# MoonLion theme for elementaryOS

![MoonLion](screenshot-clean.png)

![MoonLion](screenshot-dirty.png)

This theme just mixes and packs two great GNOME themes from [kxmylo][kxmy] for [elementaryOS][luna] 0.2 "Luna":

- [Lion][lion]
- [Lion GTK 3.8][lgtk]

Additionally, annoying errors messages and syntax warnings were fixed from some GTK-3.0 CSS files.

## Installation

Just clone this repository into your `~/.themes/` directory (create it if it doesn't exist):

    $ cd
    $ mkdir .themes
    $ git clone https://github.com/vivaserver/MoonLion.git

Select "MoonLion" for the **Window Decoration Theme** and **Interface Theme** options of the "Appearance" settings.

You will need to install the `elementary-tweaks` package from the [elementary-update PPA][eppa] to enable the "Tweaks" option in your System Settings application.
